# Privacy Policy

- 1. We collect: Your user ID, your warnings, etc.
- 2. We need this for the certain functions of the bot to work properly.
- 3. We use this data in the bot for certain commands.
- 4. Your warning count is shown in the warnings command, but other than that, nothing else is shown, as far as I know.
- 5. Kind of! All your data is saved behind a MongoDB Database, and only the warning context gets shown publicly!
- 6. You can contact the developer of Moderation Man in the [Support Server](https://discord.gg/nv4pyCXBnr) if you have any concerns!
- 7. Some data cannot be deleted by the developer (as it's too important), but can be deleted manually by a server moderator if at all nessesarry!

That's the end of the Privacy Policy, but please remember number 6 if you have any kind of concerns with your data.
